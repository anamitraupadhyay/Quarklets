SimpleParser.java and Tokenizer.java(crucial to core implementation but ai usage is absolutely minimum)
examples/servlet-app(heavy usage)
exampleofrunnablelikeandsimpleflowlike(all by ai, as this was just for experimienting and testing and is non-necessary)

P.S: ServletJsonProcessor.java is crucial to the implementation which has taken ai help and all other core implemntation as well as designing are done by anamitraupahyay.
